The lonely one
==============

Oh woeful youth! | 
All thou have, yet ne'er enough | 
Bless'd cup overfloweth, yet ne'er satisfied thy soul's pit | 
Spring's flowers blossometh and bees abuzz, yet autumn's fall thou always long | 
Wonder abound and fair love still, yet distant worlds thine wond'rous eyes forever shine
